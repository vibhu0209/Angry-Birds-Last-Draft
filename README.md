# Angry Birds - Last Draft (I think)
## Overview

This project is a browser-based physics puzzle game inspired by the popular Angry Birds franchise. Using HTML5, JavaScript, and web technologies, it recreates the slingshot mechanics and level-based destruction gameplay in a compact and extensible codebase.

---

## Features

- Drag-and-release slingshot control.
- Multiple destructible object types and enemies.
- Scoring based on efficiency and damage.
- Progressive level difficulty.
- Custom loading screen for improved UX.
- Responsive user input on desktop and mobile.

---

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Main entry point and game canvas.
- `js/`: Core JavaScript game logic and resource management
  - `main.js`: Application startup, initialization, and loading.
  - `game.js`: Game scenes, physics, and mechanics.
  - `resources.js`: Resource list and assets.
- `sprites/`: Image assets for birds, blocks, enemies, UI.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and open `index.html` in a modern web browser supporting Canvas and WebGL.  
For development, serve the folder via a local HTTP server to avoid cross-origin issues.

---

## Custom Loading Screen

The project replaces the default loading screen with a custom HTML overlay showing loading progress percentage and brand/logo. The custom loading screen visuals and code were enhanced with AI assistance to optimize user experience and responsiveness.

## Asset Attribution

- Sprite and image assets are sourced from open-source libraries and repositories, used under their respective licenses and permissions.
- All game assets, including sprites and backgrounds, have been curated and optimized for performance and style consistency.
